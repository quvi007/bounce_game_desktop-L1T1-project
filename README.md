# Bounce Game Desktop L1-T1 Project
My term project of BUET CSE'18 L-1 T-1, my very first project in BUET life. It is basically the full functioning Windows Version of 'Bounce Game' we used to play in Nokia phones ( This one has a higher resolution graphics of course ) This project was built using C Programming Language and an OpenGL Wrapper (iGraphics). It was fun to implement Newtonian Mechanics. Project-mate Sohaib Bin Musa.
